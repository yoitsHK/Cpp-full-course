/*      Object Oriented Programing      */

/*
    //  Introduction
    ->  Old name of C++ is c with classes.
    ->  C++ was designed with only intension of adding object oriented features to C.
    ->  As size of program increases,readability,maintainability and bug-free nature decreases.
    ->  The data is more secured.

    //  OOPs
    ->  Works on the concept of classes and objects.
    ->  A class is a template to create objects.
    ->  It treats data as a critical element.
    ->  Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects.

    //  Basic concepts & termonology
    ->  Classes- Basic template for creating objects.
    ->  Objects- Basic run time entities.
    ->  Data Abstraction & Encapsulation- Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
    ->  Inheritance- Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
    ->  Polymorphism- ability to take more than one forms.
    ->  Dynamic Binding- code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
    ->  Message Passing- Object.message(information) call format.

    //  Benefits of object oriented programming
    ->  Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
    ->  Principle of data hiding help build secure systems.
    ->  Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
    ->  Software complexity can be easily managed.
