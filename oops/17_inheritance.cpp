//  Inheritance
/*

    ->  In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it.
    ->  Reusing the already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort and time.
    ->  The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance.
    ->  The existing class is called as the "Base class".
    ->  The new class which is inherited is called as the "Drived class".

//  Forms of inheritance
/*

    ->  Single inheritance
            - A drived class with only one base class.
     
    ->  Multiple inheritance
            - A drived class with more than one base class.

    ->  Hierarchical inheritance
            - Several derived class from a single base class.

    ->  Multilevel inheritance
            - Deriving a class from already derived class.

    ->  Hybrid inheritance
            - It is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
